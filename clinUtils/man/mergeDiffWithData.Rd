with the original \code{newData} or \code{oldData}.}
\usage{
mergeDiffWithData(diffData, newData, oldData)
}
\arguments{
\item{diffData}{Object of class 'diff.data' containing

\item{newData}{data.frame object representing the new data}

\item{oldData}{data.frame object representing the old data}
}
\value{

with the extra column 'Comparison type' specifying the type

\itemize{
\item 'Change': record present in both dataset based 
on the reference variables, but with changes in the

\item 'Addition': records present in new but not in old data
\item 'Removal': records present in old but not in new data
\item 'Identical': records identical in the old and new datasets
(on both the reference and changeable variables)
